## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Christer Edvartsen, and I currently work as a senior software engineer for the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration ([NAV](https://www.nav.no/)). I mostly develop using [Go](https://go.dev/) at work, and [PHP](https://www.php.net) in my spare time. 

### Open source

In my spare time I have some open source projects that I fiddle with:

- [Imbo](https://github.com/imbo/imbo): An image server that can be used to add/get/delete images using a RESTful interface, along with on-the-fly image transformation functionality.
- [Behat API extension](https://github.com/imbo/behat-api-extension): Behat extension that provides an easy way to test JSON-based API's in.
- [TestFs](https://github.com/christeredvartsen/testfs): Virtual filesystem for PHP for use with testing, implemented using a stream wrapper.
- [PHP BitTorrent](https://github.com/christeredvartsen/php-bittorrent): PHP classes for encoding/decoding data to/from the BitTorrent format.

### Hobbies

In my spare time (when I'm not fiddling with the open source projects mentioned above) I enjoy climbing and bouldering, and in the winter time I do some skiing.
